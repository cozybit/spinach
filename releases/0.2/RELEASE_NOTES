Hello David,

We are happy to announce the second release (0.2) of the plantmesh project.
This release is composed of 3 different firmwares: node, station and
core. The three of them together allow a full plantmesh deployment.

We have also enabled external access for the LUCI web interface available in the mesh core.
Here are the credentials you need to log in:

We should schedule a meeting for the next week and discuss the next
steps.

Cheers,

+ HOWTO FLASH IMAGES

1- Connect the MeshNode to a LAN with the network IP: 192.168.1.X. Make
  sure that 192.168.1.20 is free, because that's the default IP of the
  MeshNode while in "Upgrade Mode".

2- Power on the MeshNode while holding the reset button (use a
clip/thin pen). Hold the reset
  button until you see two red and orange LEDs blinking.

  Quick sanity check: see if the station is up in the network

  $ ping 192.168.1.20

3- Flashing the firmware:

  $ atftp -p -l plant_mesh-mesh_node-release_0.1.bin 192.168.1.20

  After the transfer completes, it will take a few minutes for the flashing to
  complete.  When it completes, the MeshNode will reset and the LED pattern
  will change.

+ HOWTO TEST THE RELEASE:

1- Connect MeshCore to the LAN (a DHCP server is expected).
2- Turn on MeshStation and MeshNode.
3- Connect laptop A to MeshNode (through ethernet).
4- Connect laptop B to the AP in the MeshStation (SSID: plant-mesh-AP).
5- From laptop A/B: ping any node in the LAN (or yahoo.com if Internet
access is available).

Note: To access the Mesh Nodes:

  ssh root@PM-<2_last_byte_mac>.local

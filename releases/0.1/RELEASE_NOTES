Hey All,

We are happy to announce the first release (0.1) of the mesh plant project.
This release converts the MeshNodes in mesh L2 bridges.

Keep in mind that mesh nodes are still under heavy development. This release
should be used with demo/sales proposes only.

RELEASE NOTES
################

VERSION

MeshNode release 0.1

+ COMPONENTS

 - Flashable images for a Mesh Node (Bullet Station)

+ FEATURES

 - MeshNodes configured as wireless L2 bridge.
 - HT mode enabled (Channel 11, HT20).
 - Reach MeshNodes using mDNS ( PM-<last_2_MAC_byte> ).
 - Default root password
     user: root
     password: plantmesh

+ HOWTO FLASH IMAGES

1- Connect the MeshNode to a LAN with the network IP: 192.168.1.X. Make
  sure that 192.168.1.20 is free, because that's the default IP of the
  MeshNode while in "Upgrade Mode".

2- Power on the MeshNode while holding the reset button (use a
clip/thin pen). Hold the reset
  button until you see two red and orange LEDs blinking.

  Quick sanity check: see if the station is up in the network

  $ ping 192.168.1.20

3- Flashing the firmware:

  $ atftp -p -l plant_mesh-mesh_node-release_0.1.bin 192.168.1.20

  After the transfer completes, it will take a few minutes for the flashing to
  complete.  When it completes, the MeshNode will reset and the LED pattern
  will change.

+ HOWTO TEST IT

1- Connect MeshNode A to the LAN (a DHCP server is expected).
2- Connect MeshNode B to a laptop.
3- Ping any node in the LAN.

4- To access the Mesh Nodes:

   ssh root@PM-<2_last_byte_mac>.local
